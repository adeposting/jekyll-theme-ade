# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves migrating a Jekyll-based personal blog theme to a modern Next.js application with TypeScript, enterprise-grade tooling, and enhanced functionality. The existing Jekyll theme "jekyll-theme-ade" is a minimalist dark-themed blog with search capabilities, custom query functionality, and social media integration. The new implementation will be created in a `nextjs-theme-ade` subdirectory to avoid conflicts with the existing Jekyll codebase, maintaining all existing functionality while adding modern development practices, improved performance, better maintainability, and enhanced user experience.
